Answer 1 : The first step I would take 

##Start of Windows Answers##########################################################################################
 
WMI :

Provide WMI queries that can be run in either wmic or wmiexplorer for the following :

- Enumerate list of antivirus software's installed on the system.
- List all services on the system with start mode set to either Auto or Manual.
- Provide a WMI query to determine whether a system is a Domain Controller.

##Start of WMI Answers##############################################################################################

Answer 1: wmic /node:<enter server name or localhost (can technically omit this)> /namespace:\\root\SecuirtyCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct

Example: wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\SecuirtyCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct get displayname /Format:list

returns: displayName=Windows Defender

Answer 2: Using CMD the query would be:
wmic SERVICE WHERE "NOT StartMode LIKE 'Disabled'" get Name, StartMode

returns: Name		StartMode
	 AdAppMgrSvc	Auto
	 ....		....

Using PowerShell the query would be:
wmic SERVICE WHERE "NOT StartMode LIKE 'Disabled'" get Name"," StartMode

returns: Name		StartMode
	 AdAppMgrSvc	Auto
	 ....		....

Answer 3: using CMD the query would be:
wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\cimv2 Path Win32_ComputerSystem get DomainRole,Name

This wmi query returns a number between 0 and 5

Standalone Workstation = 0
Member Workstation = 1
Standalone Server = 2
Member Server = 3
Backup Domain Controller = 4
Primary Domain Controller = 5

returns: DomainRole	Name
	 5		Server01

Using PowerShell the query would be:
wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\cimv2 Path Win32_ComputerSystem get DomainRole","Name

returns: DomainRole	Name
	 5		Server01

##End of WMI Answers################################################################################################
PowerShell :

- Provide a PowerShell query to list all processes with id greater than 1000 and less than 2000.
- Provide a PowerShell query to list only .bak and .temp files in C:\ under all folders and subfolders.

- Get a listing of vSwitch (provided in sample)
- Get a listing of Pnic 
- Get a listing ConsoleVnic

Regular Expressions :

- Provide a regex that matches all numbers less than or equal to 1048576.
- Provide a regex such it matches the "foobar" set to true/false/yes/no regardless of the case :
  for e.g. 
  foobar = true 
  foobar  True
