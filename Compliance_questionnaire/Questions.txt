Windows :

1 - You are asked to harden a Windows Server before it goes in production. What steps will
  you take to make the system production ready? Now assume, this server is going to have
  IIS installed on top it. What additional steps would you take, and why?

##Start of Windows Answers##########################################################################################

Answer 1 : Read Below answer or see Hardening_Process.docx

The very first thing is more assumptions are going to have to be made due to partial vagueness of the question. For instance did we build there server? Or similar to the environment that I am currently in, did someone else build the system and now it goes to the hardening team? What type of environment is this server in? What information does this system process? What is the value of the data to the system owner? How long can the system be down? Logically is this server a single application? Or part of an existing system? Etc... These question will have an impact on the security standards and controls that we have to implement on the system in order for it to be harden correctly before production deployment.

To further clarify the question we will make the following assumptions:
-	We did not build the system. The System was built by a team of Integrators and then handed over to the Security Engineers to perform the hardening.
-	This IS (Information System) is a single self-efficient independent system, not logically supporting a larger IS.
-	We will assume this system is being integrated into a datacenter environment.
-	We will assume this is a federal datacenter.
-	This system does not contain any Medical, PII, or classified information.
-	This system does not process or store payment information.
-	This system non-mission essential therefore system down time does not impact business goals
-	The data this IS contains is non-essential and is therefore a low value asset
-	The IS is hosted in a Virtual Environment
-	A continuous monitoring solution has been implemented.

Now that we have enough of the unknown variables defined for this exorcise will begin hardening said IS:
-	The first step is to insure I had all the build documentation that should have been generated during the build phase of this IS. In the event that build documents where not generated a thorough investigation will be conducted of the system to insure all parts of the IS and how it was built is documented so that proper hardening can occur.
-	I will also retrieve the latest copy of the SSP (System Security Plan) and any other SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) style documents that are relevant for the hardening process (This includes what Firewall, Antivirus, HIPS application is used, etc.…).
-	I would then research the best security practices for the software that is hosted/part of the IS.
-	If the application is non GOTS/COTS then documentation from the developers may be required as well as a code review. 
-	With this system being federal the NIST framework will be used in this situation so a thorough review of the system level controls will be researched and applied to the final security implementation plan.
-	I would then scan the system with the continuous monitoring system and document the vulnerabilities so that they can be added to the hardening plan
-	Once I have all the necessary documentation together I would then formulate a plan to implement the security changes to the system in a pragmatic way, organizing the changes I plan on making from least likely to break the application to most likely to break the application.
-	I would then perform a full system backup along with taking a snapshot of the system.
-	I would then check to insure the IS is fully updated. In the event that it is not I would check vendor documentation as well as the system builders and system owners to see if there is known conflicts that cause the application to break. If there is, those updates will be documented, and mitigations developed/researched to be put in place until the issue has been remediated and the updates are able to be installed. I would then install all/remaining updates to insure the system is fully updated before I begin hardening.
-	Assuming the updates did not cause anything to break I would create another snapshot (in the event an update did break the application, A rollback of the updates one at a time, testing the application each time would occur until the offending update was identified. It would then be documented and a mitigation strategy would be developed as necessary).
-	I would then begin applying the changes as outline in the plan I created one at a time, insuring the system is still functioning, taking snapshots and documenting the changes (Success and Failures) each step of the way.
-	Once the initial Harding process has been completed, I would scan the system again with our continuous monitoring solution to insure that It can still talk to the system and to identify any security related issues that may have been missed/added since the first scan. Assuming more has been identified the change process again would be followed to mitigate the remaining vulnerabilities.
-	I would then scan the system a final time insuring there are no outstanding vulnerabilities that have not already been documented as requiring mitigation strategies due to breaking the application.
-	I would then baseline the system, formalizing the documentation of the changes that occurred, the vulnerabilities that could not be fixed due to breaking the application, the open/listening ports operating on the system as well the application behind those ports. This step could include taking a hash of the system that could be used to compare in the future to identify changes. This depends on the sites baselining policies.
-	At this point the snapshots can/should be deleted. The Initial backup that was taken will abide by the sites retention policies and will be deleted as those policies dictate.
-	The system at this point can continue to the next team for integration into production.

Those are the step I would take to harden the system. The fact that IIS is installed does not change the hardening process. If the technician performing the Hardening is thorough then IIS best security practices are researched and the proper Security Framework controls are added to the security plan during the research phase of hardening.

WMI :

Provide WMI queries that can be run in either wmic or wmiexplorer for the following :

1 - Enumerate list of antivirus software's installed on the system.
2 - List all services on the system with start mode set to either Auto or Manual.
3 - Provide a WMI query to determine whether a system is a Domain Controller.

##Start of WMI Answers##############################################################################################

Answer 1: wmic /node:<enter server name or localhost (can technically omit this)> /namespace:\\root\SecuirtyCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct

Example: wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\SecuirtyCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct get displayname /Format:list

returns: displayName=Windows Defender

Answer 2: Using CMD the query would be:
wmic SERVICE WHERE "NOT StartMode LIKE 'Disabled'" get Name, StartMode

returns: Name		StartMode
	 AdAppMgrSvc	Auto
	 ....		....

Using PowerShell the query would be:
wmic SERVICE WHERE "NOT StartMode LIKE 'Disabled'" get Name"," StartMode

returns: Name		StartMode
	 AdAppMgrSvc	Auto
	 ....		....

Answer 3: using CMD the query would be:
wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\cimv2 Path Win32_ComputerSystem get DomainRole,Name

This wmi query returns a number between 0 and 5

Standalone Workstation = 0
Member Workstation = 1
Standalone Server = 2
Member Server = 3
Backup Domain Controller = 4
Primary Domain Controller = 5

returns: DomainRole	Name
	 5		Server01

Using PowerShell the query would be:
wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\root\cimv2 Path Win32_ComputerSystem get DomainRole","Name

returns: DomainRole	Name
	 5		Server01

PowerShell :

1 - Provide a PowerShell query to list all processes with id greater than 1000 and less than 2000.
2 - Provide a PowerShell query to list only .bak and .temp files in C:\ under all folders and subfolders.

##Start of PowerShell Answers#######################################################################################

Answer 1: Get-Process | where{$_.Id -gt 1000 -and $_.Id -lt 2000}

returns: Handles NPM(K)	PM(K) WS(K) VM(M) CPU(s) Id    ProcessName
	 638	 25	700   4916  59    38.48  1936  spoolsv
	 ...	...	...   ...   ...   ...    ...   ...

You can add a select or select-object at the end to return just the names of the process

Get-Process | where{$_.Id -gt 1000 -and $_.Id -lt 2000} | select ProcessName

returns: ProcessName
	 spoolsv
	 ...

Answer 2: Get-ChildItem C:\ -recurse | where{$_.Extension -eq ".bak" -or $_.Extension -eq ".temp"}

returns: Directory: C:\AMD\WU-CCC2\ccc2_install
	Mode	LastWriteTime		Length	Name
	-a---	7/3/2014 6:55 PM	6656	setup.bak
	...	...			...	...

This output can be pretty hard to read especially if your traversing the entire C drive. you can pipe the query to Format

Get-ChildItem C:\ -recurse | where{$_.Extension -eq ".bak" -or $_.Extension -eq ".temp"} | Format-table name

returns: Name
	 setup.bak
	 ...

Answer 1: /proc is a Virtual filesystem which does not reside on a disk, but it resides on system memory (RAM). The files and directories in this filesystem are used by system to register processes they run and also the setting (tunables) of the operating systems get loaded from the disk to the /proc filesystem when the system boots up, so that the system doesnt have to reach to the disk everytime it has to read some setting or values.

It Also holds some real time statistical information such as process ID's cpu memory and IO stats and kernel Values. This filesystem is useful for users to read/fetch data , when they need to read some values from the kernel.

Answer 2:
I would cd into my dev folders and issue a du -hsx /* | sort -rh This command will allow me to see what my biggest directories are and I can continue traversing the file system deleting old projects and applications that are no longer needed. Now if this was really my dev system I do not have anything on the system that is not contained in a backup and everything is documented so I would just reimage and rerun my setup scripts to redeploy the dev system. A dev system should be reimage every so often anyways as it builds up crud

The benefits of Setuid allows an executable to run with the permissions of its owner or group. This is helpful in cases where you wouldn’t want to give rights to an individual user, except in a controlled way. For example, sendmail is sometimes setuid, so that when a user attempts to send mail, the application is able to drop the outgoing email in the spool directory which is normally not accessible by everyone.

The Security implications can be pretty significant. For example if the setuid application allows the user to escape to a shell, then the user can do anything as the other user. This is call privileged escalation.

Answer 4:
	4.1:
		find / -perm -4000 -o -2000  or find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -2000 \) -print : Both commands are basically the same I have found no difference in the amout of entries returned in my test environment.
	
	4.2:
		find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls
						

Answer 5:

	you redirect output to /dev/null 2>&1 when you want to execute a program quietly. It sends all output to dev/null including stderr, Everything in dev/null is automatically discarded. This could be usfull for silent cron jobs.

Answer 6:
	head -nx <file> && tail -nx <file>

the -n flag alows you to fill in for x the number of lines you want to read

Answer 7:
	diff --ignore-all-space --ignore-blank-lines <file1> <file2>

Answer 8:
	You can use the following:
				netstat -tulpn
				if you need more find the port and the protocal for the next command
				fuser 3567/tcp - this will return the PID that opened that port
				ls-l /proc/4561/exe - This will return the process

Answer 9:
	The result of the question is to only retrieve files that have either warn or error contained in them if they have been modified in the last 7 days. Instead of greping through every single file on the system only to pipe that content to a filter to only display the last 7 days’ worth of files that contains our search string we should first find the files that have changed in the last 7 days and then grep through those for our search string.

find / -ctime -7 | egrp -Hlrn 'error|warn'

Answer 10:
-	Open a terminal on your computer and type ssh-keygen. You will be prompted for a filename. Just hit enter to continue. You will then need to enter a passphrase a couple of times and then it generates your key
-	The ssh-keygen program generated two files: /home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
-	The first file is your private key id_rsa. This should be backup and kept in a safe place. This key should only be on YOUR system.
-	The second file is your public key id_rsa.pub. This file will be compied to each server you want to log into and append it to /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
-	To copy your public key to a server you will issue the following command ssh-copy-id <server>
-	You will be prompted to eater your normal login password on the server and then your public key will be installed
-	Password-less ssh setup is completed

GIT

1 - Describe the process to commit files to git.

2 - How will you unstage a file that has already been staged?
3 - How will you revert to an old revision of file after a bad commit?

##Start of GIT Answers#######################################################################################

Answer 1:
Typically before I do a commit I do a git status to see the files that have been changed and if I need a quick reminder I will do a git diff to see the changes. This allows me to breakup up the commits into smaller logical parts if I made a lot of changes without making commit. Usually I make a commit after each logical small change. After I see what has change I then do a git add <filename> or I do a git add * to add everything. I then do a git commit and type my change commit following the style guide from https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/. 

Answer 2:
git reset HEAD <file> or you can use * to unstage everything

Answer 3:
perform a git log to git a list of commit hashes. Then you use git check <hash> to checkout the commit. You keep doing this until you have reverted to the file that is correct.
